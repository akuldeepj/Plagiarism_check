As a result, the use of technology in the learning processes of students of different disciplines became essential and the only way to teach, communicate and collaborate for months. In this crisis context, we conducted a longitudinal study in four German universities, in which we collected a total of 875 responses from students of information systems and music and arts at four points in time during the spring-summer 2020 semester. Our study focused on (1) the students' acceptance of technology-mediated learning, (2) any change in this acceptance during the semester and (3) the differences in acceptance between the two disciplines. We applied the Technology Acceptance Model and were able to validate it for the extreme situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. We extended the model with three new variables (time flexibility, learning flexibility and social isolation) that influenced the construct of perceived usefulness. Furthermore, we detected differences between the disciplines and over time. In this paper, we present and discuss our study's results and derive short-and long-term implications for science and practice.\n","Body Text 0: Digital technologies have provided support in diverse policy, business, and societal application areas in the COVID-19 outbreak, such as pandemic management (Radanliev et al., 2020b) , corporate communications (Camilleri, 2020) , analysis of research data (Radanliev et al., 2020a) , and education (Crawford et al., 2020) . COVID-19 started as a global infectious disease in the spring of 2020, but the necessary measures to control the virus went beyond treatment and were also directed against its spread. Thus, for months, all interpersonal relationships were characterized by social distancing, and the pandemic raised not only medical but also social, economic and technological issues, among others. Higher education was one domain that the pandemic affected radically (Nuere and de Miguel, 2020; Watermeyer et al., 2020) . During the worldwide lockdown, higher educational institutions had to immediately switch their activities from the classroom and the campus to a virtual space, which was the only alternative to a complete incapacity to act (Crawford et al., 2020; Kamarianos et al., 2020; Karalis and Raikou, 2020; Owusu-Fordjour et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2020) .\n","Body Text 1: University students represent a generation of digital natives for whom this steady switch from the real to the virtual world should not pose any operational challenge (Carlson, 2005; Berk, 2009; Jones et al., 2010) . However, research indicates that students show differences according to discipline, such as subject matter (Biglan, 1973; Neumann, 2001) or facets of digital literacy and competency (Nelson et al., 2011) , which should be taken into consideration when developing digital learning environments and approaches. The issue of whether and how teaching and learning differs across disciplines has however long been neglected in academic discourse (Neumann, 2001) . Furthermore, as in any field, the successful introduction of technology into existing processes -such as the phenomenon that occurred in the COVID-19 pandemic during the springsummer 2020 semester (or the so-called COVID-19 semester)can only be guaranteed if teachers and students show or develop appropriate attitudes, beliefs, behaviors and habits (Al-alak and Alnawas, 2011; Al-Harbi, 2011) .\n"]}],"source":["extracted_data = []\n","\n","for file in pdf_json_files:\n","    file_path = os.path.join(pdf_json_folder, file)\n","    with open(file_path, \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as json_file:\n","        data = json.load(json_file)\n","        paper_id = data[\"paper_id\"]\n","        title = data[\"metadata\"][\"title\"]\n","        abstract = data[\"abstract\"][0][\"text\"] if data[\"abstract\"] else \"\"\n","        body_text_0 = data[\"body_text\"][0][\"text\"] if len(data[\"body_text\"]) > 0 else \"\"\n","        body_text_1 = data[\"body_text\"][1][\"text\"] if len(data[\"body_text\"]) > 1 else \"\"\n","        \n","        \n","        extracted_info = {\n","            \"paper_id\": paper_id,\n","            \"title\": title,\n","            \"abstract\": abstract,\n","            \"body_text_0\": body_text_0,\n","            \"body_text_1\": body_text_1,\n","        }\n","        extracted_data.append(extracted_info)\n","\n","\n","\n","print(\"Paper ID:\", extracted_data[0][\"paper_id\"])\n","print(\"Title:\", extracted_data[0][\"title\"])\n","print(\"Abstract:\", extracted_data[0][\"abstract\"])\n","print(\"Body Text 0:\", extracted_data[0][\"body_text_0\"])\n","print(\"Body Text 1:\", extracted_data[0][\"body_text_1\"])\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-04T11:59:43.142578Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-04T11:59:43.141869Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-04T11:59:43.167685Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-04T11:59:43.167007Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-04T11:59:43.142537Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["                                   paper_id  \\\n","0  261a1408be03a4ba06ce2fef3c6775fecb60e167   \n","1  efe13333c69a364cb5d4463ba93815e6fc2d91c6   \n","2  9fda06fbd81a070cdecf38a1d7a1248b300187d8   \n","3  4fcb95cc0c4ea6d1fa4137a4a087715ed6b68cea   \n","4  33ed0464cb31e4621ea878050f0a3f2f3d59bfa2   \n","\n","                                               title  \\\n","0  Students' Acceptance of Technology-Mediated Te...   \n","1  Clinical and epidemiological characteristics o...   \n","2  Journal of Clinical VirologyCoV-2 B.1.1.529 (O...   \n","3  End-tidal carbon dioxide levels during resusci...   \n","4  Molecular Research on Platelet Activity in Hea...   \n","\n","                                            abstract  \\\n","0  In response to the impending spread of COVID-1...   \n","1                                         Background   \n","2                                                      \n","3  Abnormal levels of end-tidal carbon dioxide (E...   \n","4  Zhao and Devine [1] exhaustively provide an up...   \n","\n","                                         body_text_0  \\\n","0  Digital technologies have provided support in ...   \n","1  a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a111111111...   \n","2  A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant (Pango lineage B.1....   \n","3  Improvements in neonatal intensive care have r...   \n","4  Zhao and Devine [1] exhaustively provide an up...   \n","\n","                                         body_text_1  \n","0  University students represent a generation of ...  \n","1  Our data systemically presented the clinical a...  \n","2  2.1.
