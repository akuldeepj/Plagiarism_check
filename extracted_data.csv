261a1408be03a4ba06ce2fef3c6775fecb60e167,Students' Acceptance of Technology-Mediated Teaching -How It Was Influenced During the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020: A Study From Germany,"In response to the impending spread of COVID-19, universities worldwide abruptly stopped face-to-face teaching and switched to technology-mediated teaching. As a result, the use of technology in the learning processes of students of different disciplines became essential and the only way to teach, communicate and collaborate for months. In this crisis context, we conducted a longitudinal study in four German universities, in which we collected a total of 875 responses from students of information systems and music and arts at four points in time during the spring-summer 2020 semester. Our study focused on (1) the students' acceptance of technology-mediated learning, (2) any change in this acceptance during the semester and (3) the differences in acceptance between the two disciplines. We applied the Technology Acceptance Model and were able to validate it for the extreme situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. We extended the model with three new variables (time flexibility, learning flexibility and social isolation) that influenced the construct of perceived usefulness. Furthermore, we detected differences between the disciplines and over time. In this paper, we present and discuss our study's results and derive short-and long-term implications for science and practice.","Digital technologies have provided support in diverse policy, business, and societal application areas in the COVID-19 outbreak, such as pandemic management (Radanliev et al., 2020b) , corporate communications (Camilleri, 2020) , analysis of research data (Radanliev et al., 2020a) , and education (Crawford et al., 2020) . COVID-19 started as a global infectious disease in the spring of 2020, but the necessary measures to control the virus went beyond treatment and were also directed against its spread. Thus, for months, all interpersonal relationships were characterized by social distancing, and the pandemic raised not only medical but also social, economic and technological issues, among others. Higher education was one domain that the pandemic affected radically (Nuere and de Miguel, 2020; Watermeyer et al., 2020) . During the worldwide lockdown, higher educational institutions had to immediately switch their activities from the classroom and the campus to a virtual space, which was the only alternative to a complete incapacity to act (Crawford et al., 2020; Kamarianos et al., 2020; Karalis and Raikou, 2020; Owusu-Fordjour et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2020) .","University students represent a generation of digital natives for whom this steady switch from the real to the virtual world should not pose any operational challenge (Carlson, 2005; Berk, 2009; Jones et al., 2010) . However, research indicates that students show differences according to discipline, such as subject matter (Biglan, 1973; Neumann, 2001) or facets of digital literacy and competency (Nelson et al., 2011) , which should be taken into consideration when developing digital learning environments and approaches. The issue of whether and how teaching and learning differs across disciplines has however long been neglected in academic discourse (Neumann, 2001) . Furthermore, as in any field, the successful introduction of technology into existing processes -such as the phenomenon that occurred in the COVID-19 pandemic during the springsummer 2020 semester (or the so-called COVID-19 semester)can only be guaranteed if teachers and students show or develop appropriate attitudes, beliefs, behaviors and habits (Al-alak and Alnawas, 2011; Al-Harbi, 2011) ."

In addition, significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase and Î±-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase were detected in 28 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 82%) and 25 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 74%), respectively. Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82%). Ground-glass opacities, which were a typical feature in adults, were rare in pediatric patients (3%). Rapid radiologic progression and a late-onset pattern of lesions in the lobules were also noticed. Lesions in lobules still existed in 24 (among 32 patients with lesions; 75%) patients that were discharged, although the main symptoms disappeared a few days after treatment. All patients were discharged, and the median duration of hospitalization was 10.00 (8.00-14.25 ) days. The current study was limited by the small sample size and a lack of dynamic detection of inflammatory markers.","Our data systemically presented the clinical and epidemiological features, as well as the outcomes, of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Stratified analysis was performed between mild and moderate cases. The findings offer new insight into early identification and intervention in pediatric patients with COVID-19."
9fda06fbd81a070cdecf38a1d7a1248b300187d8,Journal of Clinical VirologyCoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) Variant of Concern,,"A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant (Pango lineage B.1.1.529) was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) (https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(B.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern) from the Republic of South Africa on 24 November 2021 and was classified two days later as a VOC with the name ""Omicron"" (for a simplified reference) [1] . First identified in countries in the southern part of Africa, the variant has quickly appeared worldwide. Omicron has already become the dominant variant in Europe by replacing the Delta variant, and is replacing other variants in other continents. Omicron is characterised by more than 50 nucleic acid changes (including deletions). Most of these mutations reside in the S gene encoding for the spike glycoprotein [2] . The spike plays a central role in the entry of the virus into human cells through interaction with the human ACE2 receptor [3, 4] , and is the main antigenic component of mRNA-and viral vector-based vaccines [5] [6] [7] [8] . Consistent evidence indicates that by acquiring these mutations, the Omicron variant infects the cells more efficiently, replicates faster and spreads at superior rate in comparison to other previously emerged variants [2, 9] . These mutations may also render certain vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 less effective in preventing infection [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . After less than one month (19 December 2021) from its first reporting, 11,615 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences had been deposited in GISAID [15] , 10,755 of them were flagged as ""complete"" and with less than 5% undetermined bases. After two months from its first reporting, according to the Pango nomenclature, four Pango lineages were defined as Omicron B.1.1.529, BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3. By screening the S gene of all Omicron-flagged complete sequences, we identified unique and Omicron-specific sequences of B.1.1.529, BA.1 and BA.2 (which together include more than 99% of Omicron sequences) to be used for the development of a novel real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based method for the specific identification of the Omicron.","2.1. In silico design of the RT-PCR method SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences deposited in GISAID, flagged as ""complete"" and with less than 5% undetermined bases have been downloaded and analysed with Nextclade [16] (Supplementary Material S1). Only mutations present in at least 80% of the analysed sequences were retained to define a set of commonly shared mutations. The S gene, in which most of these mutations occur, was manually inspected to look for genomic regions not longer than 250 bp and with at least 6 mutations. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence NC_045512.2 was used as reference [17] . A region (NC_045512.2:22950-23150) was identified with these features and fed into Primer3Plus [18] to design in silico primers and probes methods (program run with pre-loaded qPCR settings). A candidate method, specific for the genomic region NC_045512.2:22991-23128, was selected. We call this method OMicron METhod (OmMet) [19] . OmMet has been tested in silico by using the thermonucleotideBLAST software [20] with the following parameters: -e 20 -E 20 -l 200 on the selected set of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. A set of Pango lineages [1] consensus sequences was obtained by running an inhouse developed script that parses data retrieved from the Broad Institute COVID CG [21] application programming interface (used consensus_threshold of 0.9). This set was used to check in silico the OmMet specificity. Sequence alignments were produced by using MAFFT online service [22] and alignments' representations were obtained by running the showseq tool of EMBOSS package [23] ."

Our aim was to determine whether carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels in the first 3 days after birth reflected abnormal EtCO 2 levels in the delivery suite, and hence, a prolonged rather than an early insult resulted in IVH. In addition, we determined if greater EtCO 2 level fluctuations during resuscitation occurred in infants who developed IVH. EtCO 2 levels during delivery suite resuscitation and CO 2 levels on the neonatal unit were evaluated in 58 infants (median gestational age 27.3 weeks). Delta EtCO 2 was the difference between the highest and lowest level of EtCO 2 . Thirteen infants developed a grade 3-4 IVH (severe group). There were no significant differences in CO 2 levels between those who did and did not develop an IVH (or severe IVH) on the NICU. The delta EtCO 2 during resuscitation differed between infants with any IVH (6.2 (5.4-7.5) kPa) or no IVH (3.8 (2.7-4.3) kPA) (p < 0.001) after adjusting for differences in gestational age. Delta EtCO 2 levels gave an area under the ROC curve of 0.940 for prediction of IVH.","Improvements in neonatal intensive care have resulted in decreased mortality rates of preterm infants. The development of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), however, can result in long-term adverse outcomes. Several studies of preterm infants have demonstrated that abnormal levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) within the first few days post-delivery are associated with the development of IVH [1, 2] . We recently reported that preterm infants who developed an IVH had higher endtidal CO 2 (EtCO 2 ) levels in the delivery suite during resuscitation [3] . It has not, however, been determined whether abnormal EtCO 2 levels during resuscitation of preterm infants translate into abnormal CO 2 levels over the subsequent 72 h after birth, and hence, whether it is a prolonged rather than an early insult which results in the development of IVH. Our aim then was to study EtCO 2 levels in the delivery suite during resuscitation of preterm infants and their relationship to the subsequent CO 2 levels within the first 3 days after birth and the development of IVH.","In one study of very low birth weight infants, not only high but also low partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) were associated with severe IVH development, as was a greater degree of fluctuation in pCO 2 levels within the first 4 days after birth [2] . In term infants, undergoing therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes were also associated with a greater degree of pCO 2 variability [4] . Preterm and unstable infants are more susceptible to changes in cerebral blood flow and display pressure passivity [5] . Furthermore, fluctuations of pCO 2 can adversely affect cerebral oxygenation and perfusion and the electrical activity of the brain [6] ; such fluctuation is predictive of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes [7] . We have demonstrated that not only high EtCO 2 levels during resuscitation in the delivery suite were associated with IVH development but also inflations resulting in larger tidal volumes and lower EtCO 2 levels [3] . Those findings were subsequently confirmed by Mian and colleagues who found that tidal volumes in excess of 6 ml/kg were associated with cerebral damage in the neonatal period [8] . A further aim, therefore, of this study then was to test the hypothesis that infants exposed to the largest fluctuations in EtCO 2 levels during resuscitation in the delivery suite would be at greatest risk of developing an IVH."
